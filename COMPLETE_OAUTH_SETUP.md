# Complete GitHub OAuth Setup for FlowDesk

## Quick Setup Checklist

### âœ… Step 1: Register GitHub OAuth App
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/applications/new
2. Fill in the form:
   ```
   Application name: FlowDesk Ticket System
   Homepage URL: https://sirhcrd.github.io/flowdesk-ticket-system
   Authorization callback URL: https://sirhcrd.github.io/flowdesk-ticket-system
   Application description: Collaborative ticket management system
   ```
3. Click "Register application"
4. **Copy your Client ID** (looks like: `Ov23li...`)
5. **Generate and copy your Client Secret** (looks like: `github_pat_...`)

### âœ… Step 2: Update Client ID in Code
1. Open `static/js/github-oauth.js`
2. Replace this line:
   ```javascript
   this.clientId = 'Ov23liK8J9X4fN2pQ8mH'; // Replace this with your real client ID
   ```
   With your actual Client ID:
   ```javascript
   this.clientId = 'YOUR_ACTUAL_CLIENT_ID';
   ```

### âœ… Step 3: Deploy with Netlify (Recommended)
1. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
   - Deploy the site

2. **Set Environment Variable**:
   - In Netlify Dashboard â†’ Site Settings â†’ Environment Variables
   - Add: `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` = `your_client_secret_here`

3. **Update OAuth App**:
   - Go back to your GitHub OAuth App settings
   - Update the URLs to your Netlify domain:
     ```
     Homepage URL: https://your-site.netlify.app
     Authorization callback URL: https://your-site.netlify.app
     ```

## Alternative: GitHub Pages + External Serverless Function

If you want to keep using GitHub Pages:

1. **Create a separate repository** for the OAuth function
2. **Deploy the function** to Netlify/Vercel separately  
3. **Update the OAuth URLs** in `github-oauth.js` to point to your function

## Testing the Setup

1. **Open your deployed site**
2. **Click "Sign in with GitHub"**
3. **You should be redirected to GitHub**
4. **After authorizing, you should be redirected back**
5. **You should see "ðŸ’¾ Full Access" in the navigation**

## Troubleshooting

### "OAuth not properly configured" alert
- Your Client ID is still the placeholder
- Update it in `github-oauth.js`

### "Token exchange failed" error
- Client Secret not set in Netlify environment variables
- Redirect URI doesn't match exactly
- Netlify function not deployed properly

### "Authentication expired" after some time
- GitHub tokens expire, this is normal
- Users just need to re-authenticate

## Security Features

âœ… **Client Secret Security**: Kept on server, never exposed in browser  
âœ… **State Validation**: Prevents CSRF attacks  
âœ… **HTTPS Required**: GitHub OAuth requires secure connections  
âœ… **Token Storage**: Securely stored in localStorage  
âœ… **Automatic Cleanup**: Handles token expiration gracefully  

## What Happens After Authentication

1. âœ… User is authenticated with GitHub
2. âœ… User is automatically added to the FlowDesk user database
3. âœ… User can create, edit, and manage tickets
4. âœ… All changes are saved to the GitHub repository
5. âœ… Real-time collaboration with other authenticated users
